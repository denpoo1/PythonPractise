RANGES OF NUMBERS

When writing ranges of numbers in text, the word “through” or “to” should be used to connect them.

Example:
Samples 6 through 10 were reacted in a similar manner but at approximately 100°C.

When the ranges are numbers of several digits, no digits from the 2nd number in the range should be omitted.

Example:
1938 through 1942
[not “1938–42”]

If a range of values begins a sentence, both numbers in the range, the span word, and the units are spelled out.

Example:
One hundred thirty to one hundred eighty grams per liter is the hemoglobin reference range for men.
[not “One hundred thirty to 180 g/L is the hemoglobin reference range for men.”)

Ranges of numbers and their accompanying units are expressed with a single unit symbol following the 2nd number of the range, except when the symbol is set close without spacing.

Examples:
20 to 30 kg
120 to 130 km/h
10% to 100%
