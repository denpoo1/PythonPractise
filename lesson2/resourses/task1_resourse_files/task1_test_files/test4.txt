PERCENTAGES

In scientific writing, percentages are expressed using numerals and the percent sign (%), with no space between them.

Examples:
The success rate was 95%.
The equivalence margin ranged from –15% to +15%.

If the percentage starts a sentence, both the number and “percent” are spelled out.

Example:
Twenty-five percent of the samples were positive.
