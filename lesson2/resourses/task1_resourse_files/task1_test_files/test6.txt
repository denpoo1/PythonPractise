WHAT TRADEMARK SYMBOLS ARE THERE?

There are three commonly used trademark symbols: TM, SM, and the R-in-a-circle—®.

    TM is used to indicate an unregistered trademark. It is an informal notification that there is a public claim as a trademark.
    SM represents an unregistered service mark. It is an informal notification that there is a public claim as a service mark.
    The R-in-a-circle, or ®, advises the public that the mark is registered and its use gives trademark holders exclusive rights over names, logos, colors, or sounds that distinguish their goods or services from others. The ® may be used only with registered marks. Use of an ® with an unregistered trademark may lead to claims of fraud.
